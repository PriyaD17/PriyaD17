## Hello World ðŸ‘‹

I am Priyadharsani, a student and a passionate coder who loves to solve problems and create innovative solutions. When I'm not coding, I enjoy writing poetry about life experiences.

Here are some ideas to get you started:
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Open Source contributions, DSA
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning MERN Stack, Rust, Dev Ops, Go
-  ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Multitasking, Grieving and Poetry
