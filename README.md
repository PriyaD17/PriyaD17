I am Priyadharsani - Student by chance, Coder by Choice 🚀

A proud advocate of the **ask-questions-no-matter-how-stupid-they-sound** philosophy 🧐 and a connoisseur of the **hit-and-trial method** 🧪—because what's coding without a little experimentation?

- 🖥️ Languages: `JavaScript`, `Golang`, `Rust`, `C++`
- 🌐 Web Dev: `React`, `Tailwind`
- ⚡ Fun Fact: My codes are just like my jokes—*funny to some, lame to others*—but guess what? They always work!💡
- 🌱 **Learning**: `Golang`, `Kubernetes`, `Type Script`
