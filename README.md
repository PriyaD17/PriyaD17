## Hello World 👾 

If you love tech, weird humor, and code that's sometimes more mysterious than clear—well, you've come to the right place. 🙌

I am Priyadharsani - Student by chance, Coder by Choice 🚀

A proud advocate of the **ask-questions-no-matter-how-stupid-they-sound** philosophy 🧐 and a connoisseur of the **hit-and-trial method** 🧪—because what's coding without a little experimentation?

## 💻 Tech Stack
- 🖥️ Languages: `JavaScript`, `Golang`, `Rust`, `C++`
- 🌐 Web Dev: `React`, `Vite`, `CSS Wizardsry`
- 🔐 Security Geek: `Blockchain`
- ⚡ Fun Fact: My codes are just like my jokes—*funny to some, lame to others*—but guess what? They always work!💡


 ## 🎯 Currently Working On:
- 🌱 **Learning**: `Golang`, `Kubernetes`, `Type Script`
- 🚀 **Building**: An Expense tracker to help me keep my expenses in check 📋 (and help you too!)
- 💡 **Contributing**: GWOB (GirlScript Winter of Bitcoin), GSSOC Extd (GirlScript Summer of Code Extended), Hacktoberfest
- 📚 **Reading**: A self-improvement book to balance life outside the code!
